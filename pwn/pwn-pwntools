RELRO: Relocation Read-Only, which makes the global offset table (GOT) read-only after
the linker resolves functions to it. The GOT is important for techniques such as the ret-to-libc attack.

Stack canaries: Tokens placed after a stack to detect a stack overflow.

NX: is short for non-executable. If this is enabled, then memory segments can be either writable or executable,
but not both. This stops potential attackers from injecting their own malicious code
into the program, because something in a writable segment cannot be executed.

PIE: Position Independent Executable. This loads the program dependencies into random locations,
so attacks that rely on memory layout are more difficult to conduct.
