runlevel									# show runlevel
runlevel 3									# change the runlevel

Runlevel 0: The system state when it is halted or powered off.
	    This is not an effective runlevel, but it can be called on to execute a system shutdown.
Runlevel 1 (Single User Mode): The state where only one user (root) can log in to the system to conduct
            administrative tasks. Networking is disabled for this runlevel and only the command-line interface is used.
Runlevel 2 (Multiuser Mode): The network is disabled and the command-line interface is used.
Runlevel 3 (Multiuser Mode with Networking): The command-line interface is used and networking is enabled.
Runlevel 4: Undefined by default. This is available for a custom runlevel, if required.
Runlevel 5 (Multiuser Mode with a Graphical User Interface): Networking is enabled.
	    This is the default runlevel_on any Linux distribution that is using a GUI.
Runlevel 6: The runlevel to restart the Linux host. This is another runlevel that is not effective,
	    but it can be called on to execute a system restart.
