## add a sleeping function ##
Beware that some sandboxes may alter built-in sleep functions.
various Anti-Virus vendors have put out blog posts about bypassing built-in sleep functions.
So it is highly recommended you develop your own sleep function.

## geolocation filter ##
You may choose to implement a geolocation filter on your program that checks if
the IP Address block is owned by the company you are targeting or if it is from a residential address space

## check system info ##
Most Sandboxes typically have reduced resources.
A popular Malware Sandbox service, Any.Run, only allocates 1 CPU core and 4GB of RAM per virtual machine



## check network info ##
Almost no Malware Sandboxes are joined in a domain,
so it's relatively safe to assume if the machine is not joined to a domain, it is not the right target.
However, you cannot always be too sure, so you should collect some information about the domain to be safe.
There are many objects that you can query

Computers
User accounts
Last User Login(s)
Groups
Domain Admins
Enterprise Admins
Domain Controllers
Service Accounts
DNS Servers



## raw shellcode ##
