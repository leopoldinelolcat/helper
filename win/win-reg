# Amcache Hive
Apart from these files, there is another very important hive called the AmCache hive.
This hive is located in C:\Windows\AppCompat\Programs\Amcache.hve.
Windows creates this hive to save information on programs that were recently run on the system.

# log & backup
For example, the transaction log for the SAM hive will be located in C:\Windows\System32\Config in the filename SAM.LOG. Sometimes there can be multiple transaction logs as well.
In that case, they will have .LOG1, .LOG2 etc., as their extension.
It is prudent to look at the transaction logs as well when performing registry forensics

These hives are copied to the C:\Windows\System32\Config\RegBack directory every ten days.
It might be an excellent place to look if you suspect that some registry keys might have been deleted/modified recently.
